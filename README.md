This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.1.

## Development server

We will  need two terminals to run the application:

1st - Run `npm i` to install all dependencies

2nd - Run `npm install -g json-server` to install this module which serves as the backend to test the application

3rd - In one terminal run `npm run db` to start json-server

4th - In the other terminal run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
